At a glance
-all pages were made responsive

[old page] Here's an example of the pages which needed improvement

[banner, subnav, breadcrumbs] banner integrated with current ATL campaign artwork, featuring hero plan.


[carousel steps 1 and 2 | step 3 4 5]new design created with a stepped approach, making it easy for users to understand. User testing was then conducted with a handful of customer service reps, which allowed us to refine the design further and highlight key plan features, and clear feedback as to plan availability. Checkbox element created to allow for clear feedback as to what has been selected.


[step 6] order summary was simplified to make all costs transparent, with a large primary CTA. 

[accordion] further information about each product was neatly concealed within and expandable accordion, reducing the height and complexity of the page. Awards and testimonials, which act as support for purchase decision have been included on every plan page. 

[responsive images] All pages are now responsive, and X% of traffic is on mobile
