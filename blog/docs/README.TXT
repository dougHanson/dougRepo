Simple PHP Blog:
----------------

About
-----
I started this project because I wanted a dead-simple blog. One that
didn't need a database, used flat text files, and looked nice. It's
main advantage is that it only requires PHP 5.0 and write permissions.

There is no setup, just unzip and copy. (But you might want to look
at the INSTALL.TXT file...)

SPHPBlog is among the faster and simpler blogging engines.


Requirements
