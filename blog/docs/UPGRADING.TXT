Upgrading
---------
There are two recommened ways to upgrade.

Note
----
Always make a backup of your "config", "content", and
"images" folders. It's probably a good idea to download
them to your hard-drive. (I would recommend making a
monthly backup.)
After you have installed to new version, logout and the
log back in. Click on the "Upgrade Comments" link if it
appears.

Option 1
--------
1) FTP the files to a NEW directory on your web server.
2) Copy the "config", "content", and "images" folders into
the NEW directory.
3) Verify that everything works.
4) Delete the old installation.
5) Rename the new installation.

Option 2
--------
1) Delete all file and folders EXCEPT "config", "content",
and "images"
2) FTP the files to your web server.
