Simple PHP Blog:
----------------

Installation
------------
1) Download and unzip the .zip file.
2) Copy files to your web server where you want Simple PHP Blog to appear.
3) Set file permissions for your webserver.  (See #2 below)
4) Visit the index.php page.  (If blank, see #1 below)
5) Follow on screen instructions.  (See #3 below)

Trouble Shooting
----------------
1.  You may just end up with a blank page.  If this happens there is a likely 
a PHP error behind it, but it is not displayed on the page for security 
reasons.  It should appear in your usual error log for PHP.  If you don't 
know where this is or it is not accessible to you, your should open 
scripts/sb_functions.php and comment or remove the following line near the 
top:

error_reporting( 0 );

After this, refresh the page and the error should show on the page itself.  
Once you correct the errors and the page loads normally, you should restore 
this line for security purposes.


2. Simple PHP Blog stores all of your information in three
separate folders. These folders are dynamically created:

config/
content/
images/

The installation process will attempt to create these folders and requires 
write permissions to create them.  This is usually 770 (owner: rwx, 
group: rwx).  You may need 775 or even 777 (NOT RECOMMENDED!) in shared 
hosting environments, but be very careful with these as it can expose your 
configuration to other users or even the entire internet.

Alternatively, for the most secure file permissions, you can manually create 
these three folders and set the write permissions yourself on only them, 
typically 770.

After setting the permissions properly, visit the index.php page
again. It will walk you through the rest of the process.


3. If you are still having trouble saving your username and
password, it is most likely due to a SAFE MODE issue.

By default, PHP is set to run in SAFE MODE.

PHP does a UID (User ID) compare check when opening files.
If the "sb_functions.php" file has a different UID then the
"config" directory, then it will not be able to write any
files to it...

The solution is to change the UIDs of all the files and
directories so that they are all the same. This will enable
the PHP files to create files and directories.

This can be accompilshed with the CHOWN command, if you
has access to the server. Otherwise, you will need to
contact your service provider, and tell them to change
the UID of the directory.
